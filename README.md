# Thompson_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project for CSCI2270 - Data Structures, Spring 2015, University of Colorado Boulder

Project Summary:
My collaborator Emma and I intend to build a project based on the graphs data structure which will allow the user to
evaluate a planned trip in their electric vehicle. The user will be able to input their vehicles information, which
we will then use to determine what their battery's range is. The user will then input a desired starting and
ending location, with the option to include desired intermediate stops, and the program will determine what the
shortest path between their start and end are, and if they can make the trip on a single charge. If the trip cannot be
made on a single charge in their vehicle then we would like to include charging station data (probably Tesla's Supercharger
network) and have the program suggest the best route to their desired ending location that will take the user
through a path with charging availability.
