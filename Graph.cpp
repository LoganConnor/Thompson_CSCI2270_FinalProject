Function Prototype:
void Graph::addEdge(string, string, int);

Function Description:
This function creates a connection between two already existing nodes in the graph.
First both sides of the edge (nodes) are found, then each node has its adjacencies
vector modified with a new addition, and the edge is given a weight value.
Note that the second half of the function is commented out because having a square
matrix in the txt file makes it redundant.

Example:
Graph cg;
cg.addEdge("Boulder", "Seattle", 890);

Pre-conditions: Both cities must already exist in the graph, weight must be >0 since it's a distance
Post-conditions: The cities will have a weight, bi-directional connection in the graph
